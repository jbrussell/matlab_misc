Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit - user guide
==============================================

The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit (MSAT) is designed to 
facilitate the analysis and modelling of observations of seismic
and elastic anisotropy. This user guide provides information on
the range of link:MSATfunctions.html[functions] provided by the 
toolkit along with some brief comments on the background theory 
implemented within them. The user guide also includes link:examples/index.html[examples] of how MSAT can be used. Some of the examples are included in a paper published in Computers and Geosciences (volume 49, pages 81 - 90) which describes MSAT. This is available online as a link:http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~walker/pubs/msat.pdf[preprint] or from link:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.031[Elsevier].

For the impatient there is a shorter document describing 
how to link:MSATstart.html[get started] with MSAT and a 
of link:funcs/index.html[list of functions] with links to 
what each function does. 

We also provide copies of the link:MSATrelease_notes.html[release notes],
link:MSATreadme.html[installation guide], link:MSATreadme.html[licencing details]  and some tips
for people intrested in link:MSATdevelop.html[developing] or 
modifying the toolkit (this includes information on 
how to run the test suite).
